# Aadhar Drishti 🇮🇳  
**A UIDAI Hackathon Project**

Aadhar Drishti is a privacy-first, government-grade digital system focused on **Aadhaar data freshness, usability, and citizen awareness** — without accessing, storing, or displaying any personal or biometric data.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Many Aadhaar-linked services fail or get delayed due to:
- Outdated demographic information
- Lack of awareness about data freshness
- No unified visibility for administrators
- Poor citizen feedback loops

Aadhar Drishti addresses this by providing **data freshness insights** and **actionable nudges**, while strictly complying with Indian data protection laws.

---

## 🛡️ Privacy & Compliance

This system is designed with **privacy-by-design** principles and strictly follows:

- Aadhaar Act
- DPDP Act (Digital Personal Data Protection Act)
- Zero storage of personal or biometric data
- No Aadhaar number, biometrics, or identity data exposed

---

## 🧩 System Architecture

The platform consists of two panels:

### 🔹 Admin / Government Dashboard
- Aggregate Aadhaar data freshness metrics
- Regional and service-level insights
- Trend analysis & visualization
- Policy-level decision support (no individual data)

### 🔹 Citizen Panel
- Awareness about Aadhaar data freshness
- Guided update reminders (non-intrusive)
